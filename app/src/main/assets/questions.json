Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\n\nSecond Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep my commandments.\n\nThird Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.\n\nFourth Commandment.\n\nRemember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbathday, and hallowed it.\n\nFifth Commandment.\n\nHonor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\n\nSixth Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not kill.\n\nSeventh Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not commit adultery.\n\nEighth Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not steal.\n\nNinth Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\n\nTenth Commandment.\n\nThou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.",
